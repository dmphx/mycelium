"""Multi-debrid abstraction.

When MULTI_DEBRID_ENABLED is true, check_cached_multi() queries all configured
providers (TorBox + RealDebrid). The candidate selector in processor.py uses
this to prefer cached releases across providers, falling back to a second
debrid if TorBox doesn't have a release cached.

Currently TorBox is primary and RealDebrid is fallback only  -  they don't share
.strm files, so a RealDebrid-only release would need RD-specific URL handling
that the .strm generator can't produce yet. The plumbing is in place for when
that's added.
