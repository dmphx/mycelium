<h3>The hidden network beneath your media library.</h3>

<p>
  One container that turns watchlist clicks into Jellyfin-ready streams via
  <a href="https://torbox.app">TorBox</a> or <a href="https://real-debrid.com">RealDebrid</a> -
  typically under 30 seconds for cached releases, with zero local storage.<br>
  Inspired by <a href="https://docs.elfhosted.com/app/catbox/">elfhosted CatBox</a>:
  torrents are added on-demand at playback, released after idle time.
  Your library can be as large as you want.<br>
  Also includes <strong>Mycelium Spore</strong> — a custom-built Plex integration that streams
  directly from TorBox CDN without rclone, FUSE, or local storage. <em>(experimental)</em>

## 🍄 What is Mycelium?

Browse TMDB, click **+ Add**, and within seconds a `.strm` file lands in your Jellyfin library
that streams directly from TorBox or RealDebrid. No FUSE, no rclone, no local downloads.

```
  Built-in Discover UI   OR   Seerr / Jellyseerr webhook
              |                          |
  Zilean + Torrentio  ->  cache-check TorBox / RealDebrid  ->  best release
                                    |
                    .strm files with Catbox proxy URLs
                                    |
          Jellyfin plays  ->  /stream/<token>  ->  CDN (on-demand)
```

**Two UIs, one container:**

| | Path | Purpose |
|--|--|--|
| **SPA** | `/` | Discover, Library, Watchlist, multi-user request management |
| **Admin** | `/admin` | Overview, requests, blacklist, maintenance, settings, logs |

**Works with:**

| Media server | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Jellyfin** | Primary target, fully tested |
| **Emby** | `.strm` support built-in |
| **Kodi** | Add the `.strm` folder as a source |
| **Plex** | Via optional WebDAV (see FAQ) |
| **Infuse** | Via WebDAV |

## 🌱 Why Mycelium?

The existing debrid-to-media-server toolchain kept breaking: RealDebrid purged content without warning, FUSE mounts don't survive Synology's kernel, and strm-based alternatives wiped libraries on restart with no way to diagnose why. Mycelium replaces the Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr/Bazarr/Seerr/rclone/FUSE stack with a single container.

> *Mycelium is the network of fungal threads beneath every forest. It connects the trees and keeps them alive. The mushroom is the only part you see.*

## ✨ Features

<details open>
<summary><b>Core pipeline</b></summary>

- **Two request paths**: built-in TMDB browser OR Seerr/Jellyseerr webhook
- **Zilean + Torrentio** combined search with deduplication and health-aware skipping
- **TorBox + RealDebrid** cache-first strategy with 429 retry and per-hash blacklist
- **Jellyfin-friendly naming**: `Movie (Year)/Movie (Year).strm`, `Series/Season XX/S01E01.strm`
- **Automatic library refresh** after every add

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Catbox lazy materialization (recommended)</b></summary>

Each `.strm` contains a proxy URL (`/stream/<token>`) instead of a direct CDN link. Mycelium pre-warms the torrent in TorBox at add-time so first play is instant. For series, each episode play triggers a background preload of the next (waterfall). The torrent is released after idle time. Library size is effectively unlimited.

## 🍄 Mycelium Spore *(experimental — work in progress)*

**Mycelium Spore** is a custom-built Plex integration developed specifically for Mycelium. Unlike solutions that require rclone, FUSE mounts, or virtual filesystems, Spore works entirely through a lightweight transcoder wrapper — no kernel modules, no extra daemons, no local storage.

Plex streams directly from TorBox CDN on demand.

```
Plex scans stub .mkv files  →  user presses Play
  →  Plex Transcoder called with -i /plex-media/movie.mkv
  →  plex_transcoder_wrapper.sh rewrites -i to http://mycelium/spore-stream/<token>
  →  FFmpeg reads real video directly from TorBox CDN
  →  Plex serves stream to client
```

**How it works:**
- Mycelium writes a small stub `.mkv` per item into a Plex-scanned folder — no real video data, just enough metadata for Plex to display the library
- A transcoder wrapper intercepts every playback request and replaces the stub path with a live CDN stream URL
- On first play, Mycelium builds a fast-start cache in the background so subsequent seeks are instant
- Audio and subtitle tracks are automatically updated in the stub after first play

**Setup** (Docker Compose):

```yaml
environment:
  - SPORE_ENABLED=true
  - SPORE_MEDIA_PATH=/data/plex-media   # path Plex scans
volumes:
  - ./data/plex-media:/plex-media:ro    # mount into Plex container (read-only)
  - ./spore:/spore                       # wrapper script
```

In your Plex container, add an entrypoint that installs the wrapper once:

```yaml
entrypoint:
  - /bin/sh
  - -c
  - |
    if [ ! -f '/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex Transcoder.real' ]; then
      mv '/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex Transcoder' '/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex Transcoder.real'
    fi
    cp /spore/plex_transcoder_wrapper.sh '/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex Transcoder'
    chmod +x '/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex Transcoder'
    exec /init
```

> **Status:** Confirmed working on Android (Plex app) and Linux desktop. Shield TV testing in progress. Dolby Vision and lossless audio passthrough are not supported — Plex always transcodes via the wrapper.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A [TorBox](https://torbox.app) account (Essential plan or higher recommended)
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) running

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8088:8088 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  --name mycelium \
  corveck/mycelium:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/corveck79/mycelium.git
cd mycelium
docker compose up -d
```

Open **`http://<your-host>:8088`** - the setup wizard walks you through everything. Each step has a **Test** button. The first account you create becomes admin.

**Optional add-ons** (not needed to get started):
- [Zilean](https://github.com/iPromKnight/zilean) - self-hosted hash index, faster and private
- [RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com) - fallback debrid when TorBox misses
- [Jellyseerr](https://jellyseerr.dev) / [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev) - request portal via webhook
- [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/consumers) - auto subtitle download

## 🔒 Security

- All UI and API routes require login. CSRF protection on all forms.
- **Webhook secret** auto-generated on first start, shown in Admin > Integration Endpoints. Copy to Seerr: Header `X-Webhook-Secret`. Override with `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`.
- `/setup` locked after first run - admin only via Settings > Re-run wizard.
- `/metrics` requires admin session or `X-Metrics-Token` header (`METRICS_TOKEN` in `.env`).
- WebDAV (`/dav`) uses HTTP Basic Auth against the Mycelium user database.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Most settings are hot-reloadable via the Settings tab. Only scheduler intervals require a restart.

Full reference: [`.env.example`](.env.example). Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |

## 📡 Observability

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe - wired to Docker `HEALTHCHECK` |
| `GET /healthz` | Deep readiness - 503 if scrapers down |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus, ~20 metrics. Requires auth (see Security) |

A ready-made Grafana dashboard lives at [`assets/grafana-dashboard.json`](assets/grafana-dashboard.json).

---

## ⚠️ TorBox API rate limits

TorBox enforces two limits on `POST /torrents/createtorrent`, **per IP**:

| Limit | Window |
|---|---|
| 60 requests | per hour |
| 10 requests | per minute |

In Catbox mode (default), `createtorrent` is only called on first playback, not at add-time. Normal single-user usage stays well within the limits. All other endpoints: 5 req/s per IP.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from TMC?</b></summary>

TMC deletes the entire `.strm` library on restart, crashes during metadata builds, and has no UI for diagnosing what went wrong. Mycelium rebuilds the same idea with WAL-mode SQLite, per-IMDB mutexes, idempotency on webhooks, daily backups, a recovery wizard, and a dashboard so you can see what's happening.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from elfhosted's CatBox?</b></summary>

CatBox is a managed hosting service. Mycelium runs on your own hardware with your own TorBox account. The Catbox-style lazy mode is directly inspired by their work and credited as such.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Fixed strm vs Catbox mode - what's the difference?</b></summary>

**Fixed**: each `.strm` contains a direct TorBox CDN URL. Simple, but URLs expire after ~24h.

**Catbox mode**: each `.strm` contains `/stream/<token>`. Mycelium pre-warms at add-time, fetches a fresh CDN URL on every play. No URL rot, unlimited library size, but Mycelium must be running.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does Plex work?</b></summary>

Use **Mycelium Spore** — see the [Spore section](#-mycelium-spore-experimental--work-in-progress) for setup. No rclone or FUSE required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this work with Radarr / Sonarr?</b></summary>

Yes, for bulk migration. Admin > Radarr/Sonarr import pulls your entire monitored library in one click. For ongoing requests, use the built-in SPA or Seerr webhook - Mycelium doesn't act as a Radarr download client.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will this run on a Raspberry Pi?</b></summary>

Probably. Memory footprint ~150 MB in Lite mode. The image ships ARM64 and ARMv7 variants. Untested.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My library disappeared after a restart!</b></summary>

The `./data` volume isn't mounted. Check `docker compose config` and verify `./data:/data`. If the DB is corrupted: Admin > Recovery wizard rebuilds it from the `.strm` files on disk.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I made a bad request and now it's stuck retrying.</b></summary>

Admin > Blacklist tab > add the offending hash. The blacklist auto-fills after `BLACKLIST_FAIL_THRESHOLD` consecutive failures (default 3).
